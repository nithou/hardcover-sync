## Overview

This plugin allows you to synchronise your book collection in Calibre with your shelves on a [Goodreads.com](http://www.goodreads.com/) account.

Goodreads targets the social aspects of sharing your book lists with friends and family. It offers various services such as reviews, book clubs, discussions and recommendations. You can maintain shelves of books you have read, want to read, are currently reading or others of your own design.

In some cases this is information that you also want to keep track of within Calibre using tags or custom columns. Typical examples of usage of this plugin are:

- Adding a book that you have just imported to Calibre to your 'to-read' shelf on Goodreads
- Updating a Calibre custom column to indicate that you have read a book when syncing from your 'read' shelf on Goodreads
- Multiple actions can be applied. e.g. in the example above you might also populate a 'Read Date' custom column and remove a 'To Read' tag from the book in Calibre.
- Using your own genre shelves in Goodreads like science-fiction, romance etc to map to Calibre tags or a custom genre column of your choice.
